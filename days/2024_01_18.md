## Flutter navigation

- Navigation and routing are used to navigate between screens, or handle deep links.
- Small applications without complex deep linking can use `[Navigator](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html)`, while apps with specific deep linking and navigation requirements should also use the `[Router](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Router-class.html)` to correctly handle deep links on Android and iOS, and to stay in sync with the address bar when the app is running on the web.
- Deep link is a hyperlink that redirects the user to a specific section of the mobile app or site. A deeplink is a URI (**Uniform Resource Identifier**).
