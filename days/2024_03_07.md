## Firebase email verification

After clicking on the verification link from the email, the user info will not reloaded automatically, so we need to reload to make sure that, the data is the newest update.

```dart
switch (snapshot.connectionState) {
  case ConnectionState.done:
    final user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
    if (user != null) {
      user.reload(); // User info need to be reloaded
      if (user.emailVerified) {
        return const NotesView();
      } else {
        return const VerifyEmailView();
      }
    } else {
      return const LoginView();
    }
  default:
    return const CircularProgressIndicator();
}
```
