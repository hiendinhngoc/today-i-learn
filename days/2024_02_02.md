## dispose

`dispose()` is a method in **State** class, it's used to release the memory allocated to variables when state object is removed.

For example, if you are using a stream in your application then you
have to release memory allocated to the stream controller. Otherwise,
your app may get a warning from the PlayStore and AppStore about memory
leakage.

`dispose()` method called automatically from stateful if not defined.

In some cases dispose is required for example in `CameraPreview`, `Timer` etc.. you have to close the stream.

When closing the stream is required you have to use it in dispose method.

`dispose()` is used to execute code when the screen is disposed. Equal to `onDestroy()` of Android.
