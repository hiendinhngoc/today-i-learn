## Flutter app running failed with outdated Kotlin version

The error `Execution failed for task ':smart_auth:compileDebugKotlin'.`
Fix: Go to `build.grade` file and update the [newest version](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/releases.html#release-details) of Kotlin.

## Flavor

The configuration to allow developers to distinguish between different builds(environments) of the same app is called a flavor. The flavors are defined in the `android/app/build.gradle` file. Details about flavors can be found [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/flavors).

### Why should we need flavor in flutter app?

Using flavors in Flutter is a common practice to manage different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) for your app. Flavors help you create variations of your app with different configurations, API endpoints, app icons, and other settings specific to each environment. Here are some reasons why using flavors is beneficial:

- Environment-specific configurations: Each environment may require different configurations such as API endpoints, third-party keys, and other settings. Flavors allow you to define these configurations for each environment, making it easier to switch between them during development.

- Separation of concerns: Flavors help in separating the concerns of different environments. This separation makes it clearer which configurations are specific to development, testing, or production, reducing the chance of errors due to misconfigurations.

- Easier debugging and testing: With flavors, you can easily switch between environments during development or testing. This is particularly useful for debugging issues that may be specific to a certain environment. It also facilitates more thorough testing in different scenarios.

- Custom branding: You might want to have different app icons, names, or branding assets for each environment. Flavors allow you to include custom branding for each environment, making it clear which version of the app you are working with.

- Version control and code maintainability: By using flavors, you can keep environment-specific configurations in separate files or directories. This makes it easier to manage changes, especially if different team members are working on different environments concurrently. It also improves code maintainability as the environment-specific code is kept separate from the main codebase.

### Why we don't use flavor for web app?

_In web app, we can run the same source code at dev, staging or production environment. Why should we use flavor at the app level to distinguish the environments in flutter app. Is it due to the differences of deploying and packaging the app between web app and flutter app?_

You're correct in noting that web apps can often run the same source code across different environments without the need for explicit "flavors" as seen in mobile app development. The use of flavors in Flutter for environment distinction is indeed influenced by the differences in deploying and packaging between web apps and mobile apps. Let's explore why flavors are more common in mobile app development, particularly with Flutter:

- Deployment Targets:
  Web Apps: Web apps are typically deployed to web servers or cloud platforms. Since the deployment target is centralized, it's easier to manage environment-specific configurations directly on the server or use configuration files without the need for distinct build flavors.
  Flutter Mobile Apps: Mobile apps need to be distributed through app stores (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store). Each distribution channel may have its own configuration requirements, necessitating the use of flavors to package the app appropriately for different environments.

- App Store Guidelines:
  Flutter Mobile Apps: App stores often have specific guidelines and restrictions, and using flavors helps in maintaining compliance by configuring aspects like API endpoints, keys, and other environment-specific details during the build process.
  Web Apps: Web deployment environments may not have as stringent guidelines, and configuration adjustments can often be handled at the server or environment level.

- Testing and Debugging:
  Flutter Mobile Apps: During development, testing may involve multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production). Flavors make it easier to switch between these environments for testing and debugging purposes.
  Web Apps: While you can switch environments in web apps, the process might be more straightforward, and the need for specific build flavors may be less pronounced.

- Packaging and Code Separation:
  Flutter Mobile Apps: Flavors in Flutter help in separating environment-specific configurations into distinct code sections or configuration files. This separation is particularly useful when dealing with sensitive information like API keys, where you can ensure that the correct key is used for each environment.
  Web Apps: The separation of configuration might be handled differently in web apps, such as through environment variables or configuration files, without the need for explicit flavors.

In summary, the use of flavors in Flutter for environment distinction is driven by the unique requirements of mobile app development, where apps are distributed through app stores and need to adhere to specific guidelines. The use of flavors facilitates seamless testing, deployment, and compliance with store requirements across different environments. In contrast, web apps often rely on server-side configurations and might not need the same level of build flavoring for environment distinctions.
