1. **Git workflow while waiting for pending PR**    
  Assuming you want to start the new user_story_2 branch on top of the work you've done in user_story_1. Here's the workflow I use in this sort of scenario:
  - Open Pull Request for `user_story_1`
  - Create new branch `user_story_2` based on `user_story_1`
    - `git checkout -b user_story_2 user_story_1`
  - Work on the new branch
  - Pull Request gets merged
  - Delete old branch
  - Rebase new branch onto

2. **FactoryBot: Traits for enums**    
  FactoryBot allows to create traits from Enums since version 6.0.0
  The automatic definition of traits for Active Record enum attributes is enabled by default, for non-Active Record enums you can use the traits_for_enum method.    
  *ex:*
  
    ```ruby
    factory :user do
      traits_for_enum :role, %w[admin contact] # you can use User::ROLES here, of course
    end
    ```

    is equivalent to

    ```ruby
    factory :user do
      trait :admin do
        role { 'admin' }
      end

      trait :contact do
        role { 'contact' }
      end
    end
    ```

    Both variants may be used like this:

    ```ruby
    create(:user, :admin)
    create(:user, :contact)
    ```
    So you can easily add new roles to a user model and start testing without adding new traits by yourself.

    **Note:** If you not provide a second argument to `traits_for_enum`, FactoryBot will attempt to get the values by calling the pluralized attribute_name class method,   which would be `User.roles` in this example.
