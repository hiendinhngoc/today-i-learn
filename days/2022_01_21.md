**Time travelling in rspec/rails**    
When basing logic on the current time its helpful for testing to have a stable time. A time that does not change. Rails has a module `ActiveSupport::Testing::TimeHelpers` that was added in Rails 4.2 to provide methods that manipulate the time during testing.

```ruby
travel_to(Time.parse("2022-01-19")) do
  puts Time.now.strftime(:date)
end

puts Time.now.strftime(:date)
```

The above code outputs `2022-01-19` and `2022-01-21` (the current date). A fun way to time travel in modern ruby.
