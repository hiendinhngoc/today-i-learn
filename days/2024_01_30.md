## Git

You cannot ignore files if they ware added to the repository. So if you want to ignore those file, you need to untrack them first:

```sh
git rm --cached path/to/your/file.txt
```

then commit the changes of the files, then add the path to ignore file.

## Add firebase to flutter app

### Step 1: Install the required command line tools

1. Install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#setup_update_cli)
2. Log into Firebase using your Google account by running the following command:

```sh
firebase login
```

3. Install the FlutterFire CLI by running the following command from any directory:

```sh
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

### Step 2: Configure your apps to use Firebase

Use the FlutterFire CLI to configure your Flutter apps to connect to Firebase.
From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to start the app configuration workflow:

```sh
flutterfire configure
```

### Step 3: Initialize Firebase in your app

1. From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to install the core plugin:

```sh
flutter pub add firebase_core
```

2. From your Flutter project directory, run the following command to ensure that your Flutter app's Firebase configuration is up-to-date:

```sh
flutterfire configure
```

3. In your lib/main.dart file, import the Firebase core plugin and the configuration file you generated earlier:

```sh
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart';
```

4. Also in your lib/main.dart file, initialize Firebase using the DefaultFirebaseOptions object exported by the configuration file:

```sh
await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);
```

5. Rebuild your Flutter application:

```sh
flutter run
```

### Step 4: Add Firebase plugins

Since Flutter is a multi-platform framework, each Firebase plugin is applicable for Apple, Android, and web platforms. So, if you add any Firebase plugin to your Flutter app, it will be used by the Apple, Android, and web versions of your app.

1. From your Flutter project directory, run the following command:

```sh
flutter pub add PLUGIN_NAME
```

2. From your Flutter project directory, run the following command:

```sh
flutterfire configure
```

3. Once complete, rebuild your Flutter project:

```sh
flutter run
```
