## Scaffold

The Scaffold is a widget in Flutter used to implements the basic material design visual layout structure. It is quick enough to create a general-purpose mobile application and contains almost everything we need to create a functional and responsive Flutter apps. This widget is able to occupy the whole device screen. In other words, we can say that it is mainly responsible for creating a base to the app screen on which the child widgets hold on and render on the screen. It provides many widgets or APIs for showing Drawer, SnackBar, BottomNavigationBar, AppBar, FloatingActionButton, and many more.

The Scaffold class is a shortcut to set up the look and design of our app that allows us not to build the individual visual elements manually. It saves our time to write more code for the look and feel of the app.
The following are the constructor and properties of the Scaffold widget class:

```dart
const Scaffold({
  Key key,
  this.appBar,
  this.body,
  this.floatingActionButton,
  this.floatingActionButtonLocation,
  this.persistentFooterButtons,
  this.drawer,
  this.endDrawer,
  this.bottomNavigationBar,
  this.bottomSheet,
  this.floatingActionButtonAnimator,
  this.backgroundColor,
  this.resizeToAvoidBottomPadding = true,
  this.primary = true,
})
```

Example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('My Home Page'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Builder(
            builder: (context) {
              return Column(
                children: [
                  const Text('Hello World'),
                  const SizedBox(height: 20),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      print('Click!');
                    },
                    child: const Text('A button'),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Scaffold vs Container

You need Scaffold widget as main parent of your page where you use container for smaller widget into page to give them different properties like size, border, padding, margin etc.
