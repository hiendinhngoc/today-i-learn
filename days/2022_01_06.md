### error: more than one character in rune literal ðŸš€

In Go we can't use single quotes for Strings in Go. We can only use double-quotes or backticks. Single quotes are used for single characters, called runes.
A rune is not a character. A rune is an integer value identifying a Unicode code point. A character may be one Unicode code point in which case 1 character is 1 rune. Most of the general use of runes fits into this case, so in practice this hardly gives any headaches. It's a concept of the [Unicode standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).
