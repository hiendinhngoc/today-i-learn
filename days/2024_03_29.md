## Set up local baseUrl for flutter app

The correct url should set to `http://10.0.2.2:3000/graphql`
Here is the reason why `10.0.2.2` works but `127.0.0.1` does not:

The difference between `127.0.0.1` and `10.0.2.2` primarily relates to their use in the context of networking within virtualized environments, such as emulators or virtual machines. Here's a breakdown of what each address represents and why `10.0.2.2` might work when `127.0.0.1` does not, especially in the context of Android development:

### 127.0.0.1 (localhost)

What it is:

`127.0.0.1` is the loopback network address. It is used to establish an IP connection to the same machine or device that the request was sent from. In simpler terms, it's a way for a computer to talk to itself.

**Common Use:** It's commonly used in development and testing to connect to servers running on the same machine. For example, if you're running a web server on your computer, accessing
`http://127.0.0.1` in your web browser would connect to that local web server.

In the Context of Emulators and Virtual Machines: When you use `127.0.0.1` in an emulator or virtual machine, it refers to the emulator or virtual machine itself, not the host machine (your development computer). This is why `127.0.0.1` does not work when you're trying to connect to a service running on your host machine from within an emulator.

### 10.0.2.2

What it is:

`10.0.2.2` is a special alias used by the Android Emulator to refer to the host machine's loopback interface (i.e., `127.0.0.1` on the host machine). It's part of the larger `10.0.2.0/24` network that is reserved for use by the Android Emulator.

**Common Use:** It's specifically used when you want your Android app running inside the emulator to connect to servers or services running on your host machine. For example, if you have a backend API running on your development machine, you would use `10.0.2.2` to access it from an app running in the Android Emulator. Why `10.0.2.2` works when `127.0.0.1` does not: Since `127.0.0.1` refers to the emulator itself, trying to connect to a service on the host machine using this address will fail. `10.0.2.2` provides a bridge to the host machine, allowing communication between the emulator and services running on the host.
