## Manage imported package

- `as` is the keyword to alias an imported package, that mean you can rename the long and ambiguous name from the libary.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart' as material;

void main() {
  material.runApp(
    material.MaterialApp(
      home: material.Scaffold(
        body: material.Center(
          child: material.Text('Using Alias in Flutter'),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

- `show` (AKA whitelist) is the keyword to get specific methods from a package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart' show PlatformException;

void main() {
  // You can use PlatformException directly without importing the entire package.
  PlatformException exception = PlatformException(code: '404', message: 'Not found');
}
```

- `hide` (AKA blacklist) is to exclude methods from a package

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart' hide Alignment;

void main() {
  // You can use widgets from the package except the 'Alignment' class.
}
```
