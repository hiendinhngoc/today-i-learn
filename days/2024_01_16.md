## Set recurring due date for Todoist

You can use nature language to set recurring due date(turn on `smart date recognition` to use this feature). Type the recurring due date into the task name using natural language, like `every Monday` or `every other week`.

### Best practices

When adding a recurring due date, follow these best practices to ensure Todoist recognizes and adds it correctly:

- Place the start date at the end: every 14 days 7am starting 1 Nov
- Place the due time after the first date: every other Tues 7am starting 1 Nov
- Specify the days of the week the due date will recur: every mon, tues, wed, and fri

_Todoist doesn't support **every day except** as a recurring due date._

## Flutter widget state

When we talk about stateful widgets being `mutable`, we are referring to the fact that they can maintain mutable state internally. The widget itself (the instance of the stateful widget class) remains **immutable**, but the associated state (an instance of the state class) can hold **mutable** data that can change over time.
