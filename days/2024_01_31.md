## Error: cannot build flutter app to simulation in vs code

When you already turned on simulation, and trying to run the app, you see the error in the `debug console`: `ERROR:D8: Cannot fit requested classes in a single dex file`

To fix this, go to `android/app/build.gradle` and add those config

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        multiDexEnabled true
    }
    ...
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:2.0.1'
}
```

then try to run the app again, it will work and build the app to the simulator normally.
