## Install gem from Gemfile and from CLI

In Rails, the `Gemfile` serves as a manifest for defining your application's dependencies, including gems. When you run `bundle install`, Bundler reads the Gemfile and installs all the gems listed in it. These gems are then made available within your Rails application's environment.

When you require a gem in Rails console, Rails leverages Bundler to load the gem from your application's bundle. Bundler ensures that the gems listed in the `Gemfile` are loaded correctly and that their dependencies are resolved.

If you install a gem directly using gem install without adding it to your `Gemfile`, Rails console won't automatically recognize it because it's not part of your application's bundle. In this case, Rails console won't be aware of the gem unless you manually require it and ensure it's available in your application's load path.

Adding gems to the `Gemfile` ensures that they are properly managed and loaded within your Rails application's environment. This approach also makes it easier to manage dependencies across different environments and ensure consistency in your application's setup.
