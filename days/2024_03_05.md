## Flutter navigation

### named routes vs anonymous routes

- [named routes](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/navigation/named-routes)

named routes used to navigate to screens by specifying their names exactly(calling `pushNamed` method):

```dart
  MaterialApp(
    routes: {
      '/home': (context) => HomeScreen(),
      '/about': (context) => AboutScreen(),
      '/settings': (context) => SettingsScreen(),
    },
    // Other properties...
  )

  Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/about');
```

- [anonymous routes](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/navigation/navigation-basics)

are used to navigate to a page back and forth with `pop` and `push` methods

```dart
  Navigator.of(context).push(
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => MyScreen(),
    ),
  );
```
