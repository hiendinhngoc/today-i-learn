## GetMaterialApp vs MaterialApp

MaterialApp + Getx properties = GetMaterialApp

## Get.offAllNamed()

You can navigate from one page to another, but when you click on the back icon, you can't go back.

## Get.lazyPut(lazyPut()

- Get.put() will put Immediately.
- Get.lazyPut() will put When you need it.

A benefit of `lazyPut` is that it saves memory until you actually find it. And you can also put more complex code in the builder for it. Another benefit of `lazyPut` is that you can also say fenix: true on it which means it's able to be reconstructed in case it got disposed of before.

I would think the only benefit of using `put` is that find should be slightly faster then when called because it doesn't need to call a builder first to get the instance. I don't know if there are other benefits.
