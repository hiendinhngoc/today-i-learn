## AWS certification

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) handles the complexity of creating, storing, and renewing public and private SSL/TLS X.509 certificates and keys that protect your AWS websites and applications. You can provide certificates for your integrated AWS services either by issuing them directly with ACM or by importing third-party certificates into the ACM management system. ACM certificates can secure singular domain names, multiple specific domain names, wildcard domains, or combinations of these. ACM wildcard certificates can protect an unlimited number of subdomains. You can also export ACM certificates signed by AWS Private CA for use anywhere in your internal PKI.

## Validate domain ownership

### DNS validation

The details of the validation can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html)

**Note:**

> The information in the resulting file needs to be added manually to your DNS database.

The term "DNS database" refers to the collection of DNS records that are stored by your DNS hosting provider. When AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) provides instructions to add DNS records manually, it means that you need to add the specified DNS record directly to the DNS configuration managed by your DNS hosting provider.
