## Enum

In Ruby on Rails, when you declare an `enum` attribute on a model, Rails automatically generates several convenience methods related to the values of the enum. This is part of Rails' Active Record features, which aim to simplify the code and increase its readability.

Given your enum declaration:

```rb
enum dispatch_type: {
  warehouse: 'warehouse',
  dispatch: 'dispatch'
}
```

Here are the methods that Rails will generate for each of the enum values (warehouse and dispatch):

### Query Methods:

These methods return `true` or `false` depending on the value of the enum attribute.

- `warehouse?` - Returns true if the dispatch_type is `'warehouse'`.
- `dispatch?` - Returns true if the dispatch_type is `'dispatch'`.

### Bang Methods:

These methods set the value of the enum attribute to the corresponding value and save the record (if it's not a new record).

- `warehouse!` - Sets the dispatch_type to `'warehouse'` and saves the record.
- `dispatch!` - Sets the dispatch_type to `'dispatch'` and saves the record.

### Scopes:

Rails also automatically defines scopes for querying the records based on the enum values.

- `warehouse` - A scope to get all records where dispatch_type is `'warehouse'`.
- `dispatch` - A scope to get all records where dispatch_type is `'dispatch'`.

These methods are very helpful for managing and querying the records based on the enum values without manually writing the conditional logic each time. They make the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Additionally, you can assign and compare the enum attributes directly with their string representations, thanks to Rails handling the mapping internally:

```rb
model.dispatch_type = "warehouse"
model.save
model.dispatch_type # => "warehouse"
model.warehouse? # => true
```

This functionality is part of what makes enums in Rails particularly powerful for handling attributes with a fixed set of possible values.

## Using enum over directly comparing string values

Using enums in Rails instead of directly comparing string values offers several benefits that can significantly enhance the maintainability, performance, and readability of your application code. Here are some of the key advantages:

1. Performance:
   Enums in Rails are typically backed by integers in the database, even though you can define them with string values in your model. When you use integers to represent different states, comparisons in the database are faster than string comparisons. This can lead to performance improvements, especially with large datasets.
2. Consistency and Safety:
   Enums enforce a set of allowed values for a field, reducing bugs related to unexpected or incorrect values. When you use methods like `warehouse?`, you avoid typos and other common mistakes associated with string literals like `'warehosue'` instead of `'warehouse'`. Rails will raise an error if you try to assign an undefined value to an enum field, helping catch errors early in the development process.
3. Convenience Methods:
   Rails automatically generates predicate methods (like `warehouse?`), scopes, and bang methods (like `warehouse!`) for enum values. This reduces the boilerplate code you need to write and maintain. For example, instead of writing a scope manually to find all records with dispatch_type == `'warehouse'`, you can simply use `model.warehouse`.
4. Readability:
   Using enums makes the code more readable and expressive. Methods like warehouse? clearly state their purpose and are more concise than `model.dispatch_type == 'warehouse'`. This makes the code easier to understand at a glance, which is beneficial during code reviews and when new developers join the project.
5. Refactoring and Scalability:
   If you decide to change the underlying value of an enum (e.g., from strings to integers or changing the string value itself), you only need to update the enum declaration in your model. All the auto-generated methods will continue to work without requiring changes throughout your codebase. This encapsulation makes refactoring easier and safer.
6. Integration with Forms:
   Enums in Rails integrate seamlessly with forms, allowing for easy generation of select tags, radio buttons, etc., based on the enum values. This integration also extends to other parts of the Rails ecosystem, like I18n for internationalization.
7. Database Integrity:
   By using integers in the database (if you choose integer-based enums), you can also leverage database constraints and ensure data integrity at the database level, which is generally more efficient than enforcing it in application code.

Overall, using enums in Rails not only provides syntactic sugar but also enhances the robustness and efficiency of the application. It abstracts common patterns around field values into a concise, reusable, and efficient manner, making your Rails application easier to develop and maintain.
